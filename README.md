Pyramid Builder is a 3D sandbox building game inspired by Minecraft, where players can construct pyramids, temples, houses, and other structures using block types like sand, stone, wood, glass, and stairs. It’s a creative, open-ended experience set in an interactive 3D world designed for building and exploration.

The game features intuitive controls:

WASD to move, Space to fly up, and Shift to descend
Left-click to place blocks, Right-click to remove them
A user-friendly hotbar lets you quickly switch between different materials
Players begin with a clean, visually appealing start screen that introduces the game and launches them into the world with a simple "Start" button. The environment includes a large ground area for building, along with preview structures like pyramids, temples, and small houses to inspire creativity and exploration.

The entire 3D world is built using Three.js, a powerful JavaScript library that enables 3D rendering in the browser. I used Three.js to handle the scene, camera, lighting, and all block geometry and materials, allowing me to create a smooth and immersive 3D experience without low-level graphics programming.

The interface is structured with HTML and styled with CSS, including the start screen, hotbar, and instructions. All gameplay logic — block placement, removal, player movement, and world interaction — is powered by JavaScript.
